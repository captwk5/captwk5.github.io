ORB SLAM 논문에 대한 해석 및 리뷰.

This paper presents ORB-SLAM, a feature-based monocular SLAM system that operates in real time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments.
이 논문은 실시간으로 크고 작은 실내외 환경에서 작동하는 feature 기반 단일 slam인 ORB-SLAM에 대한 논문이다.

The system is robust to severe motion clutter, allows wide baseline loop closing and relocalization, and includes full automatic initialization. 
이 시스템은 극심한 motion clutter에 탄탄하고 넓은 기준의 루프결합 그리고 relocalization 그리고 전체 자동 초기화를 허용한다.

Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all SLAM tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing. A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets. ORB- SLAM achieves unprecedented performance with respect to other state-of-the-art monocular SLAM approaches. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.
