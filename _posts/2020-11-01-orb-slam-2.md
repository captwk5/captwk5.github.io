ORB SLAM2 논문에 대한 해석 및 리뷰.

We present ORB-SLAM2 a complete SLAM system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, including map reuse, loop closing and relocalization capabilities. The system works in
real-time on standard CPUs in a wide variety of environments from small hand-held indoors sequences, to drones flying in industrial environments and cars driving around a city. Our
back-end based on bundle adjustment with monocular and stereo observations allows for accurate trajectory estimation with metric scale. Our system includes a lightweight localization mode that
leverages visual odometry tracks for unmapped regions and matches to map points that allow for zero-drift localization. The evaluation on 29 popular public sequences shows that our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, being in most cases the most accurate SLAM solution. We publish the source code, not only for the benefit of the SLAM community, but with the aim of
being an out-of-the-box SLAM solution for researchers in other fields.
